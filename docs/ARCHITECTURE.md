# Storage Manager App Architecture

## Overview
The Storage Manager app follows MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern and is built using modern Android development practices. The app is structured into several layers:

### Presentation Layer
- Activities and Fragments for UI
- ViewModels for business logic and state management
- Material Design components for modern, intuitive UI

### Domain Layer
- Use cases for business operations
- Repository interfaces
- Domain models

### Data Layer
- Repository implementations
- Room Database for local storage
- File system operations

## Libraries and Dependencies

### UI Components
- **Material Design Components**: Modern Android UI toolkit
  - MaterialCardView for card-based layouts
  - MaterialToolbar for app bar
  - MaterialButton for actions
  - MaterialProgressIndicator for loading states

### Storage Analysis
- **MPAndroidChart**: Visualization library for storage statistics
  - Used for pie charts showing storage category distribution
  - Customized for intuitive color schemes and interactions

### Image Loading
- **Glide**: Efficient image loading and caching
  - Used for loading file thumbnails
  - Handles caching and memory management

### Database
- **Room**: Local database for storing scan results and settings
  - Stores file metadata and scan history
  - Manages excluded folders list
  - Handles cache information

### Asynchronous Operations
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: Handling asynchronous operations
  - File system operations
  - Database queries
  - Background scanning processes

## Key Features Implementation

### Storage Analysis
The storage analysis feature scans the device's internal and external storage:
1. Uses MediaStore API for media files
2. Direct file system access for other files
3. Categorizes files based on MIME types
4. Calculates storage usage per category

### Cache Cleaning
Cache cleaning functionality:
1. Identifies app cache directories
2. Calculates cache size per app
3. Provides safe cleaning options
4. Notifies for large cache files

### Duplicate File Detection
Implements efficient duplicate file detection:
1. Initial grouping by file size
2. Secondary grouping by name patterns
3. Final verification using MD5 checksums
4. Memory-efficient processing for large files

### File Operations
Safe file operations implementation:
1. Permission checking
2. Confirmation dialogs
3. Progress tracking
4. Error handling
5. Success reporting

## UI/UX Design Principles

### Material Design Implementation
- Consistent typography using Material type scale
- Elevation and shadows for depth
- Motion design for transitions
- Responsive layouts

### User Interaction Flow
1. Main screen shows storage overview
2. Quick actions for common tasks
3. Detailed views for specific operations
4. Clear feedback for all actions
5. Confirmation for destructive operations

### Progress Indication
- Linear progress for overall storage scan
- Circular progress for specific operations
- Clear status messages
- Operation cancellation options

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Efficient bitmap handling
- Pagination for large file lists
- Cache management
- Memory-efficient algorithms

### Background Processing
- Coroutines for async operations
- WorkManager for scheduled tasks
- Process lifecycle management
- Battery-efficient operations

## Security Measures

### File Access
- Runtime permissions handling
- Scoped storage compliance
- Safe file operations
- Data integrity checks

### User Data Protection
- Secure file deletion
- Privacy-focused scanning
- Clear user consent flows
- Data minimization

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- ViewModel logic
- Use case implementation
- Repository operations
- File operation utilities

### UI Tests
- Navigation flows
- User interactions
- Error states
- Progress indicators

## Future Improvements

### Planned Features
- Cloud storage integration
- Advanced file search
- Custom cleaning rules
- Backup integration

### Optimization Opportunities
- Faster scanning algorithms
- Improved duplicate detection
- Better compression detection
- Enhanced media handling
